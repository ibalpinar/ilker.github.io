### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ilker Balpinar. This is my simple website where you can find everything about me and my portfolio.

While preparing this site and even all the products I develop as open source on GitHub, I will use MVP, which is the most widely used product development philosophy in the world.

First, you will encounter a minimal but static page, then I will turn it into a simple but dynamic page with a great UX.

I'm an engineer, and I try to produce in all engineering fields in which I am competent.  For example, software, electronics, and mechanics. 

I'm living in Istanbul, Turkey. Currently working as a Director of Software Development at [TurkNet](https://turk.net).
