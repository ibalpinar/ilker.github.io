This is my simple website where you can find everything about me and my portfolio.

While preparing this site and even all the products I develop as open source on GitHub, I will use MVP, which is the most widely used product development philosophy in the world.

First, you will encounter a minimal but static page, then I will turn it into a simple but dynamic page with a great UX.
