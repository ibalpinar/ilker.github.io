### Hi there 👋
My name is Ilker Balpinar. This is my simple website where you can find everything about me and my portfolio.

While preparing this site and even all the products I develop as open source on GitHub, I will use MVP, which is the most widely used product development philosophy in the world.

First, you will encounter a minimal but static page, then I will turn it into a simple but dynamic page with a great UX.

I'm an engineer, and I try to produce in all engineering fields in which I am competent.  For example, software, electronics, and mechanics. 

I'm living in Istanbul, Turkey. Currently working as a Director of Software Development at [TurkNet](https://turk.net).
